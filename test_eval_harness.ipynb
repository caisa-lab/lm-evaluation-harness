There were lots of other fish in the ocean where Asta lived. They played all day long. \\n\\nOne day, a bottle floated by over the heads of Asta and his friends.

So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean. They cracked it open on a rock. When they got it open, they found what was inside. It was a note. The note was written in orange crayon on white paper. Asta could not read the note. Sharkie could not read the note.
